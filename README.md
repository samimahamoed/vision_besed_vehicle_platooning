# vision_besed_vehicle_platooning

This project aimed to develop a basic platform of a vehicle platooning system which is applicable in transportation. When vehicles autonomously follow one another, the safety and the efficacy of energy consumption can be improved which provides benefits to industry as well as the environment. In a platooning process, the distance between the leading and following vehicles was maintained with a controlling algorithm. The following (rear) vehicle mimics the path of the leader. On other words, if the leading vehicle changes its lane or makes a turn, the rear vehicle repeats the same work while keeping its safety distance from the leader.

In this project, an embedded system provided with a Raspberry Pi (RPi) was applied as the base for development. The RPi was the central processing unit (CPU) for the controlling algorithm which was developed with computer vision. The algorithm were developed using functions provided by OpenCV library. Additionally Intels Movidius Neural Compute Stick (NCS) was used with the RPi to get better results in object detection. This stick facilitates the use of deep learning techniques on the RPi. A communication system was also established between the vehicles such that they could communicate and send necessary information to each other. This communicating capability will be useful when integrating with computer vision in several cases such as emergency stop or allowing another vehicle goes between them.
